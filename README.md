Project decscriptions are in their respective folders. Descriptions originate from professor provided descriptions on canvas.

Project Summaries:

Project 1: Get familiar with Matlab and image processing toolbox. Apply grayscale and functions to images and see what info you can extract out.

Project 2: Filtering noise out of images using various linear and nonlinear filters. Edge detection in images using several methods and using the hough filter to find lines in an image.

Project 3: Using normalized correlation and templates to perform template matching and find recurring segments/objects of interest in images.

Project 4: Implement Harris corner detector to find corners in a checker board and go board. Implement a SIFT like feature extractor by creating 128 dimensional descriptors for keypoints found in an image. Then match these key points and show differences.
